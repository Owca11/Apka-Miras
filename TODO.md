# TODO: Add Edit Functionality for Emotions

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Add shared_preferences dependency to pubspec.yaml (already present)
- [x] Create emotion_service.dart to manage persistent data for feelings, needs, thoughts
- [x] Modify sample_data.dart to provide initial data only
- [x] Update feeling_selection_screen.dart to load data from emotion_service instead of static lists
- [x] Add edit functionality in the dialog: button to open edit form, save changes to service
- [x] Test the app: verify data loads, edits persist, and UI updates correctly
